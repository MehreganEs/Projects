# Pizza Sales Analysis Project
 This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using MySQL and visualizing the insights with Power BI.
## Overview
 The objective of this project is to gain actionable insights into pizza sales performance through a comprehensive analysis of the data. Leveraging MySQL for data management and Power BI for visualization, this project provides a detailed examination of various aspects of pizza sales, including revenue, order trends, popular pizza categories, and more.

## Tools Used
 MySQL: The primary database management system used for storing and querying the pizza sales data. MySQL provides robust data handling capabilities essential for conducting thorough analysis.

 Power BI: A powerful business analytics tool utilized for creating interactive and visually appealing visualizations. Power BI enables the representation of complex data sets in intuitive dashboards and reports, facilitating easy interpretation of insights.

## Analysis Process
 Data Extraction: The pizza sales data is extracted from the database using MySQL queries. This step involves retrieving relevant information such as order details, pizza categories, quantities sold, and prices.

 Data Analysis: Various analytical techniques are applied to the prepared data to uncover meaningful insights. This involves calculating key performance indicators (KPIs), identifying trends, and exploring relationships within the data.

Visualization: The insights derived from the analysis are visualized using Power BI. Interactive charts, graphs, and reports are created to present the findings in a clear and compelling manner.
